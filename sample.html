            <h2>Diwali colors</h2>
            <p>Hindus celebrate the triumph of good over evil - of light over darkness - to mark the return of Ram, the lord of virtue, to his kingdom after 14 years of exile.

Followers of Jainism commemorate Mahavira, a venerated ascetic who fundamentally reformed the faith, reaching a state of nirvana after his death.

Sikhs use Diwali to mark the anniversary of the release from prison of Guru Hargobind in 1619.

For Buddhists, this day represents the time Emperor Ashoka gave up everything and adopted a path of peace after going through bloodshed and death. The day is observed as Ashok Vijayadashami. </p>
